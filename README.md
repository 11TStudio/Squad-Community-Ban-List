## About
The aim of the Squad Community Ban List, "SCBL" for short, is to protect the Squad community's integrity through collaboration and information sharing. This is achieved by pulling information from some of the largest and most reputable server organisations within the Squad community, that we have partnered with, and sharing this information via configurable remote ban lists to allow all server organisations to secure their servers from known malicious players.

## How it Works
1. Our ban importer constantly fetches bans from our partner organisation's BattleMetrics ban lists via the BattleMetrics API to ensure our local database contains the most up-to-date information on known malicious players.
2. Our database can be searched via our [Search page](https://squad-community-ban-list.com/search) to allow our users to lookup a player's reputation and for players to easily find out where they are banned and how they can appeal any bans they have.
3. Server organisations can [create custom remote ban lists](https://squad-community-ban-list.com/install) to ensure players meeting their criteria are kept banned form their server.
4. Our ban exporter rapidly updates the remote ban lists as soon as new bans are added or removed from our database so that malicious players are banned from your server as early as possible to limit the harm these players might cause to your server's community and the wider Squad community.
